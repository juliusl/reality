# Nebudeck

## What is Nebudeck?

Nebudeck offers a fresh approach to UX development. It serves as a collection of extensions for `loopio`, aimed at simplifying the creation of user interfaces for both terminal and desktop applications. It bridges the gap between `loopio` components and user experience (UX) by providing tools and extensions that are easy to use and highly adaptable to various use cases.

**Coming soon**, are a suite of command-line and desktop tools for working w/ the `loopio` ecosystem.

## Features

Nebudeck enhances the user experience by providing:

- **Integration with UX Frameworks**: It allows for loopio plugins to integrate seamlessly with other user experience frameworks.

- **Generic UX Element Definitions**: Nebudeck provides a unified approach to define UX elements such as commands and arguments, which can be utilized across different platforms and frameworks like `clap` for command-line interfaces or `imgui` for development UIs.

- **Flexible User Interface**: The library supports a generic terminal with REPL capabilities and includes a desktop event loop implementation based on `winit`.

- **Unparalleled Customization**: The essence of Nebudeck lies in its adaptability. With the ability to define commands and interfaces once and deploy them in multiple contexts, it offers an unprecedented level of reusability, shaping the way forward for UI consistency and developer efficiency.

- **For Advanced Users**: Provides plugins for common desktop libraries such as `winit`, `imgui`, `clap`, `wgpu`, `softbuffer`, to name a few.

## Getting Started

To get started with Nebudeck, users should have a foundational understanding of `loopio` and its ecosystem. The library is designed to provide just enough structure to be immediately productive while offering extensive customization options for a path to more complex applications like gaming, graphic processing, or system services.

## Accessibility

Nebudeck is committed to accessibility:

- **Terminal Applications**: By utilizing `clap`, the library offers a sophisticated help system that is compatible with screen readers and follows standard CLI conventions.

- **Desktop Applications**: For UI development, `imgui` is the chosen backend, providing a rich and accessible developer experience.

## Performance

Nebudeck is in an experimental phase regarding performance with large datasets or complex UIs. This aspect of the library will be explored and enhanced as it matures.
